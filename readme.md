# RatInABox

RatInABox simulates, you guessed it, a rat in a box. With it you can rapidly generate pseudo-realistic trajectories for rats foraging/exploring 1 and 2D environments /and simultaneously simulate spatially selective cells typically found in Hippocampus/Entorhinal cortex (place cells, grid cells<sup>*</sup>, boundary vector cells, and velocity cells<sup>*</sup>)
