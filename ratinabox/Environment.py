class Environment:
    """Environment class: defines the Environment in which the Agent lives.
    This class needs no other classes to initialise it. It exists independently of any Agents or Neurons.

    2D Environments (the default) can contain
        • a boundary  ------- if non-default (square), this must be given at initialisation
        • walls ------------- can be given at initialisation or added after
        • holes ------------- can be given at initialisation or added after
        • objects ----------- can only be given after initialisation using Env.add_object
        (beware, some Neurons classes depend on walls and holes being define before they are initialised, see their documentation - this means it is safest to define walls and holes at initialisation)

    A default parameters dictionary (with descriptions) can be found in __init__()

    List of functions...
        ...that you might use:
            • add_wall()
            • add_hole()
            • add_object()
            • plot_environment()
        ...that you probably won't directly use/use very often:
            • sample_positions()
            • discretise_environment()
            • get_vectors_between___accounting_for_environment()
            • get_distances_between___accounting_for_environment()
            • check_if_posision_is_in_environment()
            • check_wall_collisions()
            • vectors_from_walls()
